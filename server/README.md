# Server for Hotel-Client

## How to use
Commands to install and seed DB:

<code>npm install</code>

<code>npx knex migrate:latest</code>

<code>npx knex seed:run</code>

## Routes

There is only one route to use and need the **.env config**:

- {*HOST*}:{*PORT*}/api/v1/rooms

If you wanna test this route, I recommended to use:
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
- WebBrowser

If this helps you, don't forget to leave a star!

Issues about any problem are welcome too!
